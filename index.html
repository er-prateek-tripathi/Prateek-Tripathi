                        on their own, without
                        asking commands frequently and giving excellent results. When I started watching movies from
                        <strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong> my excitement and thirst about the automated machines
                        started to overflow. I started to explore AI form 8th standard and learnt programming for the
                        sake of getting a chance to be the part of this marvelous world of Artificial Intelligence.

                        CSE laying around for
                        me to grab, and most of them were from the Web Development arena. Since I was the member of ML
                        community, I was determined that I will take a job in ML field only, but that thought was in
                        contradiction with the thought that whenever a job in ML will land before me I will grab it,
                        until then why shall I not pursue my career in Web Development. There wasn't any plausible
                        answer for that, so I took the liberty of learning Web Development on my own.</p>
